# Main Project Directory
This directory contains the main file, uVision project, and other files closely associated with the project including main.cpp.  
## main.cpp
This is the home of the entire game engine. Due to a strict time crunch and the fact that I was prototyping, experiementing, and testing on the fly, I kept all game engine objects and logic in the main file so I could keep method definitions inlined and quickly change things.
